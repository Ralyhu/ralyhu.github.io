I am an Assistant Professor (RTDa) within the [Machine Learning, NLP and Network Science Team](https://mlnteam-unical.github.io/) @Artificial Intelligence and Data Science Lab at the [Department of Computer Engineering, Modeling, Electronics, and Systems Engineering (DIMES)](http://www.dimes.unical.it/), [University of Calabria](https://unical.it/), in Rende (Italy). Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the DIMES Department. I received my PhD (2021) in Information and Communication Technologies from University of Calabria. There I completed my M.Sc. (2017) and B.Sc. (2014) in Computer Science and Engineering.

My research interests lie primarily in the broad areas of `artificial intelligence` and `(algorithmic) data science`, with the main goal of tackling (novel) problems and designing effective yet efficient algorithms that are useful to gain knowledge from data. Due to the fact that much of today’s data can be represented as graphs, my emphasis has primarily been on formalizing data-driven challenges as graph problems and developing scalable methods to analyze complex relational structures. More specifically, my recent research interests include `graph mining and learning`, `explainable AI` and `natural language processing`—the latter mainly in settings where graphs come with rich textual descriptions (e.g., node/edge
metadata or associated documents) that can be leveraged to enhance graph representations and reasoning.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
