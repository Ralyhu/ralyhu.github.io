I am an Assistant Professor (RTDa) at the DIMES Department, University of Calabria, in Rende (Italy). Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the DIMES Department. I received my PhD (2021) in Information and Communication Technologies from University of Calabria. There I completed my M.Sc. (2017) and B.Sc. (2014) in Computer Science and Engineering.

My research interests lie primarily in the broad areas of <b>artificial intelligence</b> and <b>(algorithmic) data science</b>, with the main goal of tackling (novel) problems and designing effective yet efficient algorithms that are useful to gain knowledge from data. Due to the fact that much of todayâ€™s data can be represented as graphs, my emphasis has primarily been on formalizing data-driven challenges as graph problems. More specifically, my recent research interests include neuro-symbolic AI, graph mining, correlation clustering, deep learning on graphs and (combinatorial) multi-armed bandit problems.
