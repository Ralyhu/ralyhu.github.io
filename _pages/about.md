I am an Assistant Professor (RTDa) within the [Machine Learning, NLP and Network Science Team](https://mlnteam-unical.github.io/)@Artificial Intelligence and Data Science Lab at the [Department of Computer Engineering, Modeling, Electronics, and Systems Engineering (DIMES)](http://www.dimes.unical.it/), [University of Calabria](https://unical.it/), in Rende (Italy). Previously, I was a postdoctoral researcher at the DIMES Department. I received my PhD (2021) in Information and Communication Technologies from University of Calabria. There I completed my M.Sc. (2017) and B.Sc. (2014) in Computer Science and Engineering.

My research interests lie primarily in the broad areas of `artificial intelligence` and `(algorithmic) data science`, with the main goal of tackling (novel) problems and designing effective yet efficient algorithms that are useful to gain knowledge from data. Due to the fact that much of todayâ€™s data can be represented as graphs, my emphasis has primarily been on formalizing data-driven challenges as graph problems. More specifically, my recent research interests include `graph mining and learning`, `correlation clustering` and `explainable AI`.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
